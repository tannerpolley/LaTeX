  abstract  = "A modified SAFT equation of state is developed by applying the
               perturbation theory of Barker and Henderson to a hard-chain
               reference fluid. With conventional one-fluid mixing rules, the
               equation of state is applicable to mixtures of small spherical
               molecules such as gases, nonspherical solvents, and chainlike
               polymers. The three pure-component parameters required for
               nonassociating molecules were identified for 78 substances by
               correlating vapor pressures and liquid volumes. The equation of
               state gives good fits to these properties and agrees well with
               caloric properties. When applied to vapor−liquid equilibria of
               mixtures, the equation of state shows substantial predictive
               capabilities and good precision for correlating mixtures.
               Comparisons to the SAFT version of Huang and Radosz reveal a
               clear improvement of the proposed model. A brief comparison with
               the Peng−Robinson model is also given for vapor−liquid
               equilibria of binary systems, confirming the good performance of
               the suggested equation of state. The applicability of the
               proposed model to polymer systems was demonstrated for
               high-pressure liquid−liquid equilibria of a polyethylene
               mixture. The pure-component parameters of polyethylene were
               obtained by extrapolating pure-component parameters of the
               n-alkane series to high molecular weights.",

  title     = "Application of the perturbed-chain {SAFT} equation of state to
               associating systems",
  author    = "Gross, Joachim and Sadowski, Gabriele",
  abstract  = "The perturbed-chain SAFT (PC−SAFT) equation of state is applied
               to pure associating components as well as to vapor−liquid and
               liquid−liquid equilibria of binary mixtures of associating
               substances. For these substances, the PC−SAFT equation of state
               requires five pure-component parameters, two of which
               characterize the association. The pure-component parameters were
               identified for 18 associating substances by correlating vapor
               pressure and liquid density data. A comparison to an earlier
               version of SAFT confirms the good results for pure substances.
               When only one associating compound is present in a mixture, the
               PC−SAFT equation of state does not require mixing rules for the
               association term. Using one binary interaction parameter kij for
               the dispersion term only, the model was applied to azeotropic
               and nonazeotropic vapor−liquid equilibria at low and at high
               pressures, as well as to liquid−liquid equilibria. Simple mixing
               and combining rules were adopted for mixtures with more than one
               associating compound, introducing no additional binary
               interaction parameter. The simultaneous description of
               liquid−liquid and vapor−liquid equilibrium was also possible
               with a single kij parameter.",
