The aim of this article is to provide an overview on the kinetics of the reaction of CO2 with aqueous solutions of alkanolamines. The various reaction mechanisms that are used to interpret experimental kinetic data - zwitterion, termolecular and base-catalyzed hydration - are discussed in detail. Recently published data on reaction kinetics of individual amine systems and their mixtures are considered. In addition, the kinetic behavior of several novel amine-based solvents that have been proposed in the literature is analyzed. Generally, the reaction of CO2 with primary, secondary and sterically hindered amines is governed by the zwitterion mechanism, whereas the reaction with tertiary amines is described by the base-catalyzed hydration of CO2. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Special attention was given to the accurate VLE description of the system at both absorbing and stripping conditions relevant to most aqueous MEA absorption/stripping processes for CO2 removal. The influence from chemical equilibrium constants, Henry's constant, experimental data, and data regression on the representation of the VLE of the system was discussed in detail. The equilibrium constant of the carbamate reversion reaction as well as important interaction parameters of the electrolyte NRTL model were carefully fitted to experimental data. A good agreement between the calculated values and the experimental data was achieved. Moreover, the model with newly fitted parameters was successfully applied to simulate three industrial cases for CO2 removal using a rate-based approach. The results from this work were compared with those using the model by Austgen et al.},

   abstract = {The accurate characterization of the thermodynamic models of a reactive solvent-based CO 2 capture system is essential for adequately capturing system behavior in a process model. Moreover, uncertainty in these models can significantly affect simulation results, although it is often neglected. With this incentive, a model of thermodynamic properties, including vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE), enthalpy, and solution chemistry, has been developed using a rigorous methodology for the aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) system as a baseline. The final thermodynamic framework consists of both a deterministic and stochastic model. The deterministic model is developed by regressing parameters of the e-NRTL activity coefficient model in Aspen Plus ® to VLE, heat capacity, and heat of absorption data while downselecting the model's large parameter space through use of information-theoretic criteria. The stochastic model is developed through an uncertainty quantification (UQ) procedure, using the results of the deterministic regression to determine a prior parameter distribution. This prior distribution and the experimental VLE data are used to derive a posterior distribution through Bayesian inference, which is used to represent the final stochastic model. A reaction model in which the kinetics are written in terms of the reaction equilibrium constants, to ensure consistency with the thermodynamics model, is developed. These new thermodynamic and reaction models are incorporated into an existing MEA system process model from the open literature, and the prior and posterior parameter distributions are propagated through the models. This provides valuable insight into the extent to which uncertainty in thermodynamic models affects key process variables, including CO 2 capture efficiency and energy requirement for solvent regeneration.},

   abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

We discuss the role of ML in predicting the thermodynamic properties of absorbents and in improving the absorption process. For adsorption processes, we discuss the promises of ML techniques for exploring many options to find the most cost-effective process scheme, which involves choosing a solid adsorbent and designing a process configuration. We also highlight the advantages of ML and the associated risks, elaborate on the importance of the features needed to train ML models, and identify promising future opportunities for ML in carbon capture processes.},

@generic{Ma2022,
   abstract = {The large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is becoming increasingly urgent in the global path toward net zero emissions; however, global CCS deployment is significantly lagging behind its expected contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction. Reviewing and learning from the examples and history of successful CCS practices in advanced countries will help other countries, including China, to promote and deploy CCS projects using scientific methods. This paper shows that the establishment of major science and technology CCS infrastructures in advanced countries has become the main source of CCS technological innovation, cost reduction, risk reduction, commercial promotion, and talent training in the development and demonstration of key CCS technologies. Sound development of CCS requires a transition from pilot-scale science and technology infrastructures to large-scale commercial infrastructures, in addition to incentive policies; otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome the technical barriers between small-scale demonstrations and the implementation of million-tonne-scale CCS and ten-million-tonne-scale CCS hubs. Geological CO2 storage is the ultimate goal of CCS projects and the driving force of CO2 capture. Further improving the accuracy of technologies for the measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) of CO2 storage capacity, emission reduction, and safety remains a problem for geological storage. CO2 storage in saline aquifers can better couple multiple carbon emission sources and is currently a priority direction for development. Reducing the energy consumption of low-concentration CO2 capture and the depletion of chemical absorbents and improving the operational efficiency and stability of post-combustion CO2 capture systems have become the key constraints to large-scale CCS deployment. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is also important in order for countries to maximize fossil fuel extraction instead of importing oil from less environmentally friendly oil-producing countries.},

In this article, we focus on the technical developments and economic analysis of carbon capture and storage using optimization models and algorithms. The three main components of carbon capture and storage we discuss are: carbon capture, carbon dioxide transportation and carbon sequestration. In addition, to fulfill carbon dioxide reduction requirements, we also discuss the use ofmathematical programming models solving energy expansion planning, CO2 network design problems and CO 2 storage problems. Through the combination of technical and economic analysis of carbon capture and storage technologies, possible directions for sustainable developments of low-carbon energy economy can be evaluated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},
